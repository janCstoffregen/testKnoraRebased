Test Tags
=========

.. todo:: add example of how to tag a test.

Tags can be used to mark tests, which can then be used to only run tests
with a certain tag, or exclude them.

There is now the **org.knora.webapi.testing.tags.SipiTest** tag (in the
*test* folder), which marks tests that require the Sipi image server.
These tests can be excluded from running with the following command in
sbt:

``test-only * -- -l org.knora.webapi.testing.tags.SipiTest``
